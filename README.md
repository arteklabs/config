# config

POC for macOS config

# TODO

- remove linux config to dedicated repo
- app to install/uninstall components like: vscode, fonts, apps, ...
- run vscode from a docker container instead of having to install it locally
- install all the brew apps to a docker container instead of installing them locally
- essentially, move everything to docker
