# config

POC for macOS config

run: `. ./main.sh` for installing and configuring your macOS apps.

# caveat

not thoroughly tested

# TODO

- github org keys
- remove linux config to dedicated repo
- app to install/uninstall components like: vscode, fonts, apps, ...
- the backlog contains the uninstall/install scripts in the nodes
- run vscode from a docker container instead of having to install it locally
- install all the brew apps to a docker container instead of installing them locally
- essentially, move everything to docker
